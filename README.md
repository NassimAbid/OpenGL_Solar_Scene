## Overview of the Coursework

This coursework is an individual project, and you will need to demonstrate and explain your work
in a dedicated lab session. Furthermore, you will need to submit your original solution for this
coursework consisting of a small written technical report including code.
The main learning objective of this coursework is for you to create your demo scene, in doing so
you will investigate several core concepts in computer graphics theory, develop your programming
skills in 3D graphics and animation, and have a working demo to show future employers.
2 Tools, Libraries, and Environment

The following software technologies are available for the development of your demo scene:

Visual Studio IDE (https://www.visualstudio.com/)

Blender Creation Suite (https://www.blender.org/)

The following open source libraries are recommended for you to complete this coursework:

GLFW Library (http://www.glfw.org/index.html)

GLEW Library (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
 
GLM Library (http://glm.g-truc.net)

The following open source programming interfaces are required for this coursework:

OpenGL core version 4.2 or later (https://www.opengl.org/).

These technologies are available on the Edinburgh Windows machines in labs EMG47 and EMG48,
and in Dubai machines. If you want to develop your demo scene in your laptop, you may be
required to install some of the above software. Please follow the links above for download,
installation and usage instructions of all software. OpenGL is a requirement. Therefore,
coursework running in other interfaces (e.g., Unity and Unreal Engine) will receive no marks.

## Task
The assessed coursework consists of designing, understanding, and implementing a small-scale
rendering and animation system that will demonstrate the various concepts learned throughout
the course. The groundwork necessary to complete the assessment will take place in the lab
sessions from week 1 to 5. Support to complete your coursework, from a lecturer and a lab
assistant, will be available in the lab sessions from week 6 to 10.
The main requirements for your demo scene are:

1. Load instances of at least five different geometry models as objects into your scene.
2. Write your own materials and lighting shader programs for your objects.
3. Implement animation, interaction and an automatic camera system for your objects
